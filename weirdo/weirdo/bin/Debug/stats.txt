There's nothing really special about you. (This message should never appear in-game.)
Your every move hurts and you ache all over. Don't even try to run.
You're utterly underweight and you can't take a single hit.
You're as atheistic as it gets and you'll make sure to let everyone know that.
You got 2 left hands, you're the epitome of clumsiness and everything you touch WILL break.
You're mentally disabled or as you would put it - Me can't think good.
You are the world's unluckiest person. Congratulations.
You're too good-hearted to ever do something unruly.
You lost your eyesight on one eye a while ago and have a seeing disorder on the other eye...
You are an awkward fellow with absolutely no social skills.
You're physically disabled or - to put it bluntly - a complete cripple.
You're a cheater, having 2 bonus stats. (This message should never ever appear in-game!)
You're quick as a rabbit. Climbing, sprinting, jumping - it's all easy-peasy for you.
While your massive weight might be unhealthy, it provides you with tons of defense against everything.
You were raised in a strict religious community and you're still a devout worshipper of god.
Years of experience have made you a crafting genius. Whether fixing, building or using - technology is your bitch.
You've always been a model student, rivaling the likes of Einstein.
You swallowed a dice and almost choked on a clover as a kid, so now you've got the devil's luck.
You have no morals at all and thus your life is just way more fun! Go ahead and shank a bitch!
You got the eagle's eye, ears of a master musician and a master nose - even though that's annoying sometimes.
You are the master of social interaction, seduction and manipulation.
You got the perfect health for a bodybuilder and you still have the knowledge from your old martial arts career.
